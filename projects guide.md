# Bird Hangout Project

## Project Idea
My project is a bird hangout application where you book a session to spend time with our lovely birds.

### Welcome Page:
when the application starts, the client will be met with the "Welcome" page and three options to choose from:

1. **view available sessions.** 


 *Where all the available birds will be shown to the client with general information about them.*
  
2. **book a session.** 


*Where the client will book a session with a bird of their choice.*
  
3. **Exit.** 


*To exit the application.*

### Booking a Session:
When booking a session, the client needs to type the birds name. If the bird is availabe, the client will get a confirmation message  with a picture
of the bird they booked. Else, the system will inform the client that the name they typed is either not found or busy with other clients.
